Minimal demo for sending discord DMs outside of a triggered interaction.

`.env` setup:
```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<discord application client ID>
DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord bot token>
USER_ID=<your user ID>
GUILD_ID=<your guild ID (the one the bot is in)>
```

To register commands
```
npm run commands
```

To run dev:
```
npm run dev
```

When running dev, it'll provide a URL to use to add it to a server you own.
